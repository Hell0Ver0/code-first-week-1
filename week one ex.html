I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
<ol>
<li>You can understand what's going on under the hood</li>
<li>Not have to rely on someone else for a quick protype website.</li>
<li>It's fun!</li>
</ol>

<br></br>
<h2>
<em>What do you need to create a website?</em>
</h2>

  <p1>Not much!</p1>
  <li>A computer (always a good start!)</li>
  <li>A text editor(I am using atom)</li>
  <li>A web browser(I am using chrome)</li>
  <li>Some HTML some CS and JS files</li>
  <br></br>
